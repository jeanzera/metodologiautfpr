This paper describes the automatic design of user profiling methods for the purpose of fraud detection, using a series of data mining techniques. Specifically, we use a rule-learning program to uncover indicators of fraudulent behavior from a large database of customer transactions. Then the indicators are used to create a set of monitors, which profile legitimate customer behavior and indicate anomalies. Finally, the outputs of the monitors are used as features in a system that learns to combine evidence to generate high-confidence alarms. The system has been applied to the problem of detecting cellular cloning fraud based on a database of call records. Experiments indicate that this automatic approach performs better than hand-crafted methods for detecting fraud. Furthermore, this approach can adapt to the changing conditions typical of fraud detection environments.},

Most researches regard fraud companies and non-fraud companies as data subjects, Eigenvalue covers auditor data, company governance data, financial statement data, industries, trading data and other categories. Most data in earlier research were auditor data; Later research establish model by using sharing data and public statement data. Company governance data have been widely used. It is generally believed that ratio data is more effective than accounting data; Seldom research on time Series Data Mining were conducted. The retrieved literature used mining algorithms including statistical test, regression analysis, neural networks, decision tree, Bayesian network, and stack variables etc.. Regression Analysis is widely used on hiding data. Generally the detecting effect and accuracy of NN are superior to regression model. General conclusion is that model detecting is better than auditor detecting rate without assisting. There is a need to introduce other algorithms of no-tag data mining. Owing to the small size of fraud samples, some literature reached conclusion based on training samples and may overestimated the effect of model.},

abstract = {Nationwide, financial losses due to financial statement frauds (FSF) are mounting. The industry recognizes the problem and is just now starting to act. Although prevention is the best way to reduce frauds, fraudsters are adaptive and will usually find ways to circumvent such measures. Detecting fraud is essential once prevention mechanism has failed. Several data mining algorithms have been developed that allow one to extract relevant knowledge from a large amount of data like fraudulent financial statements to detect FSF. Detecting FSF is a new attempt; thus, several research questions have often being asked: (1) Can FSF be detected? How likely and how to do it? (2) What data features can be used to predict FSF? (3) What kinds of algorithm can be used to detect FSF? (4) How to measure the performance of the detection? And (5) How effective of these algorithms in terms of fraud detection? To help answer these questions, we conduct an extensive review on literatures. We present a generic framework to guide our analysis. Critical issues for FSF detection are identified and discussed. Finally, we share directions for future research.},

The defining characteristic of botnets is the use of command and control channels through which they can be updated and directed. Recently, botnet detection has been an interesting research topic related to cyber-threat and cyber-crime prevention. This paper is a survey of botnet and botnet detection. The survey clarifies botnet phenomenon and discusses botnet detection techniques. This survey classifies botnet detection techniques into four classes: signature-based, anomaly-based, DNS-based, and mining-base. It summarizes botnet detection techniques in each class and provides a brief comparison of botnet detection techniques.},

Online Social Networks (OSNs) have fetched the interest of researchers for their analysis of usage as well as detection of abnormal activities. Anomalous activities in social networks represent unusual and illegal activities exhibiting different behaviors than others present in the same structure. This paper discusses different types of anomalies and their novel categorization based on various characteristics. A review of number of techniques for preventing and detecting anomalies along with underlying assumptions and reasons for the presence of such anomalies is covered in this paper. The paper presents a review of number of data mining approaches used to detect anomalies. A special reference is made to the analysis of social network centric anomaly detection techniques which are broadly classified as behavior based, structure based and spectral based. Each one of this classification further incorporates number of techniques which are discussed in the paper. The paper has been concluded with different future directions and areas of research that could be addressed and worked upon.},

abstract = {Fraud detection mechanisms support the successful identification of fraudulent system transactions performed through security flaws within deployed technology frameworks while maintaining optimal levels of service delivery and a minimal numbers of false alarms. Knowledge discovery techniques have been widely applied in fraud detection for data analysis and training of supervised learning algorithms to support the extraction of fraudulent account behaviour within static data sets. Escalating costs associated with fraud however have continued to drive the migration towards increasingly proactive methods of fraud detection, to support the real-time screening of transactional data and detection of ambiguous user behaviour prior to transaction completion. This shift in data processing from post to pre data storage significantly reduces the available time within which to evaluate newly arriving system requests and produce an accurate fraud decision, demanding increasingly robust and intelligent user profiling technologies to support advanced fraud detection. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of existing research into account signatures, an innovative account profiling technology which maintains a statistical representation of normal account usage for rapid recalculation in real-time. Fraud detection architectures, processing models and applications to date are critically examined and evaluated with respect to their proactive capabilities for detection of fraud within streaming financial data. Discussion is also presented on challenges which remain within the proactive profiling of account behaviour and future research directions within the signature domain. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The migration from circuit-switched networks to packet-switched networks necessitates the investigation of related issues such as service delivery, QoS, security, and service fraud and misuse. The latter can be seen as a combination of accounting and security aspects. In traditional telecommunication networks, fraud accounts for annual losses at an average of 3{\%}-5{\%} of the operators' revenue and still increasing at a rate of more than 10{\%} yearly. It is also expected that in VoIP networks, the situation will be worse due to the lack of strong built-in security mechanisms, and the use of open standards.

abstract = {Social media anomaly detection is of critical importance to prevent malicious activities such as bullying, terrorist attack planning, and fraud information dissemination. With the recent popularity of social media, new types of anomalous behaviors arise, causing concerns from various parties. While a large amount of work have been dedicated to traditional anomaly detection problems, we observe a surge of research interests in the new realm of social media anomaly detection. In this paper, we present a survey on existing approaches to address this problem. We focus on the new type of anomalous phenomena in the social media and review the recent developed techniques to detect those special types of anomalies. We provide a general overview of the problem domain, common formulations, existing methodologies and potential directions. With this work, we hope to call out the attention from the research community on this challenging problem and open up new directions that we can contribute in the future.},

abstract = {Due to the rise and rapid growth of E-Commerce, use of credit cards for online purchases has dramatically increased and it caused an explosion in the credit card fraud. As credit card becomes the most popular mode of payment for both online as well as regular purchase, cases of fraud associated with it are also rising. In real life, fraudulent transactions are scattered with genuine transactions and simple pattern matching techniques are not often sufficient to detect those frauds accurately. Implementation of efficient fraud detection systems has thus become imperative for all credit card issuing banks to minimize their losses. Many modern techniques based on Artificial Intelligence, Data mining, Fuzzy logic, Machine learning, Sequence Alignment, Genetic Programming etc., has evolved in detecting various credit card fraudulent transactions. A clear understanding on all these approaches will certainly lead to an efficient credit card fraud detection system. This paper presents a survey of various techniques used in credit card fraud detection mechanisms and evaluates each methodology based on certain design criteria.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

abstract = {The increment of computer technology use and the continued growth of companies have enabled most financial transactions to be performed through the electronic commerce systems, such as using the credit card system, telecommunication system, healthcare insurance system, etc. Unfortunately, these systems are used by both legitimate users and fraudsters. In addition, fraudsters utilized different approaches to breach the electronic commerce systems. Fraud prevention systems (FPSs) are insufficient to provide adequate security to the electronic commerce systems. However, the collaboration of FDSs with FPSs might be effective to secure electronic commerce systems. Nevertheless, there are issues and challenges that hinder the performance of FDSs, such as concept drift, supports real time detection, skewed distribution, large amount of data etc. This survey paper aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of these issues and challenges that obstruct the performance of FDSs. We have selected five electronic commerce systems; which are credit card, telecommunication, healthcare insurance, automobile insurance and online auction. The prevalent fraud types in those E-commerce systems are introduced closely. Further, state-of-the-art FDSs approaches in selected E-commerce systems are systematically introduced.

While numerous techniques have been developed in past years for spotting outliers and anomalies in unstructured collections of multi-dimensional points, with graph data becoming ubiquitous, techniques for structured graph data have been of focus recently. As objects in graphs have long-range correlations, a suite of novel tech-nology has been developed for anomaly detection in graph data. This survey aims to provide a general, comprehensive, and structured overview of the state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection in data represented as graphs. As a key contribution, we give a general framework for the algorithms categorized under various settings: unsupervised versus (semi-)supervised approaches, for static versus dynamic graphs, for attributed versus plain graphs. We highlight the effectiveness, scalability, gener-ality, and robustness aspects of the methods. What is more, we stress the importance of anomaly attribution and highlight the major techniques that facilitate digging out the root cause, or the 'why', of the detected anomalies for further analysis and sense-making. Finally, we present several real-world applications of graph-based anomaly Graph based anomaly detection and description: a survey 627 detection in diverse domains, including financial, auction, computer traffic, and social networks.

For this purpose we utilize quantile modeling, whose goal is to estimate a quantile of the discriminative conditional distribution of the response, rather than the mean, which is the implicit goal of most standard regression approaches. We argue that a notion of wallet can be captured through high quantile modeling (e.g, estimating the 90th percentile), and describe a wallet estimation implementation within IBM's Market Alignment Program (MAP). We also discuss the wide range of domains where high-quantile modeling can be practically important: estimating opportunities in sales and marketing domains, defining 'surprising' patterns for outlier and fraud detection and more. We survey some existing approaches for quantile modeling, and propose adaptations of nearest-neighbor and regression-tree approaches to quantile modeling. We demonstrate the various models' performance in high quantile estimation in several domains, including our motivating problem of estimating the 'realistic' IT wallets of IBM customers. {\textcopyright} 2007 ACM.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine whether internal auditors, external auditors and economic crime investigators perceive the importance of red flags as significantly different across two fraud types: fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets, as well as across within-subject categories. A total of 471 useable responses were collected using a web-based survey. The findings indicate that significant differences exist on both single and aggregate mean levels among the participant groups. Internal auditors report a higher perceived importance of the red flags related to detecting misappropriation of assets than of those related to fraudulent financial reporting, whereas the opposite is true for economic crime investigators. For external auditors, only small differences in aggregate means between misappropriation of assets and fraudulent financial reporting were found. As the sensitivity to fraud type may affect professional planning, procedures and techniques with regard to fraud prevention, detection and investigation, the results may have both practical and theoretical implications. Further, the focus on both fraud types adds to prior literature on fraud. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper thus represents the first systematic, identifiable and comprehensive academic literature review of the data mining techniques that have been applied to FFD. 49 journal articles on the subject published between 1997 and 2008 was analyzed and classified into four categories of financial fraud (bank fraud, insurance fraud, securities and commodities fraud, and other related financial fraud) and six classes of data mining techniques (classification, regression, clustering, prediction, outlier detection, and visualization). The findings of this review clearly show that data mining techniques have been applied most extensively to the detection of insurance fraud, although corporate fraud and credit card fraud have also attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. In contrast, we find a distinct lack of research on mortgage fraud, money laundering, and securities and commodities fraud. The main data mining techniques used for FFD are logistic models, neural networks, the Bayesian belief network, and decision trees, all of which provide primary solutions to the problems inherent in the detection and classification of fraudulent data. This paper also addresses the gaps between FFD and the needs of the industry to encourage additional research on neglected topics, and concludes with several suggestions for further FFD research. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Analysis of financial ratios is one of those simple methods to identify frauds. Theoretical survey revealed that, in scientific literature, financial ratios are analysed in order to designate which ratios of the financial statements are the most sensitive in relation with the motifs of executive managers and employees of companies to commit frauds. Empirical study included the analysis of the following: 1) 40 sets of fraudulent financial statements and 2) 125 sets of non-fraudulent financial statements (unconditional audit report was issued for the sets of financial statements of these companies). The aim of the research is to distinguish financial ratios, the values of which could indicate the fraud in financial statements. Moreover, the logistic regression model of fraud detection in financial statements has been developed. The research is unique for being the first empirical study of its type in Lithuania.},
