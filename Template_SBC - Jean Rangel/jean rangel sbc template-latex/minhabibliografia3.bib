abstract = {The increment of computer technology use and the continued growth of companies have enabled most financial transactions to be performed through the electronic commerce systems, such as using the credit card system, telecommunication system, healthcare insurance system, etc. Unfortunately, these systems are used by both legitimate users and fraudsters. In addition, fraudsters utilized different approaches to breach the electronic commerce systems. Fraud prevention systems (FPSs) are insufficient to provide adequate security to the electronic commerce systems. However, the collaboration of FDSs with FPSs might be effective to secure electronic commerce systems. Nevertheless, there are issues and challenges that hinder the performance of FDSs, such as concept drift, supports real time detection, skewed distribution, large amount of data etc. This survey paper aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of these issues and challenges that obstruct the performance of FDSs. We have selected five electronic commerce systems; which are credit card, telecommunication, healthcare insurance, automobile insurance and online auction. The prevalent fraud types in those E-commerce systems are introduced closely. Further, state-of-the-art FDSs approaches in selected E-commerce systems are systematically introduced. Then a brief discussion on potential research trends in the near future and conclusion are presented.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important data analysis task. It is used to identify interesting and emerging patterns, trends and anomalies from data. Anomaly detection is an important tool to detect abnormalities in many different domains including financial fraud detection, computer network intrusion, human behavioural analysis, gene expression analysis and many more. Recently, in the financial sector, there has been renewed interest in research on detection of fraudulent activities. There has been a lot of work in the area of clustering based unsupervised anomaly detection in the financial domain. This paper presents an in-depth survey of various clustering based anomaly detection technique and compares them from different perspectives. In addition, we discuss the lack of real world data and how synthetic data has been used to validate current detection techniques.},

abstract = {Detecting anomalies in data is a vital task, with numerous high-impact applications in areas such as security, finance, health care, and law enforcement. While numerous techniques have been developed in past years for spotting outliers and anomalies in unstructured collections of multi-dimensional points, with graph data becoming ubiquitous, techniques for structured graph data have been of focus recently. As objects in graphs have long-range correlations, a suite of novel tech-nology has been developed for anomaly detection in graph data. This survey aims to provide a general, comprehensive, and structured overview of the state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection in data represented as graphs. As a key contribution, we give a general framework for the algorithms categorized under various settings: unsupervised versus (semi-)supervised approaches, for static versus dynamic graphs, for attributed versus plain graphs. We highlight the effectiveness, scalability, gener-ality, and robustness aspects of the methods. What is more, we stress the importance of anomaly attribution and highlight the major techniques that facilitate digging out the root cause, or the 'why', of the detected anomalies for further analysis and sense-making. Finally, we present several real-world applications of graph-based anomaly Graph based anomaly detection and description: a survey 627 detection in diverse domains, including financial, auction, computer traffic, and social networks.

abstract = {From its infancy in the 1910s, healthcare group insurance continues to increase, creating a consistently rising burden on the government and taxpayers. The growing number of people enrolled in healthcare programs such as Medicare, along with the enormous volume of money in the healthcare industry, increases the appeal for and risk of fraudulent activities. One such fraud, known as upcoding, is a means by which a provider can obtain additional reimbursement by coding a certain provided service as a more expensive service than what was actually performed. With the proliferation of data mining techniques and the recent and continued availability of public healthcare data, the application of these techniques towards fraud detection, using this increasing cache of data, has the potential to greatly reduce healthcare costs through a more robust detection of upcoding fraud. Presently, there is a sizable body of healthcare fraud detection research available but upcoding fraud studies are limited. Audit data can be difficult to obtain, limiting the usefulness of supervised learning; therefore, other data mining techniques, such as unsupervised learning, must be explored using mostly unlabeled records in order to detect upcoding fraud. This paper is specific to reviewing upcoding fraud analysis and detection research providing an overview of healthcare, upcoding, and a review of the current data mining techniques used therein.},

The sub-aim is to present, compare and analyze recently published findings in credit card fraud detection. This article defines common terms in credit card fraud and highlights key statistics and figures in this field. Depending on the type of fraud faced by banks or credit card companies, various measures can be adopted and implemented. The proposals made in this paper are likely to have beneficial attributes in terms of cost savings and time efficiency. The significance of the application of the techniques reviewed here is in the minimization of credit card fraud.

abstract = {Fraud detection mechanisms support the successful identification of fraudulent system transactions performed through security flaws within deployed technology frameworks while maintaining optimal levels of service delivery and a minimal numbers of false alarms. Knowledge discovery techniques have been widely applied in fraud detection for data analysis and training of supervised learning algorithms to support the extraction of fraudulent account behaviour within static data sets. Escalating costs associated with fraud however have continued to drive the migration towards increasingly proactive methods of fraud detection, to support the real-time screening of transactional data and detection of ambiguous user behaviour prior to transaction completion. This shift in data processing from post to pre data storage significantly reduces the available time within which to evaluate newly arriving system requests and produce an accurate fraud decision, demanding increasingly robust and intelligent user profiling technologies to support advanced fraud detection. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of existing research into account signatures, an innovative account profiling technology which maintains a statistical representation of normal account usage for rapid recalculation in real-time. Fraud detection architectures, processing models and applications to date are critically examined and evaluated with respect to their proactive capabilities for detection of fraud within streaming financial data. Discussion is also presented on challenges which remain within the proactive profiling of account behaviour and future research directions within the signature domain. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper describes the automatic design of user profiling methods for the purpose of fraud detection, using a series of data mining techniques. Specifically, we use a rule-learning program to uncover indicators of fraudulent behavior from a large database of customer transactions. Then the indicators are used to create a set of monitors, which profile legitimate customer behavior and indicate anomalies. Finally, the outputs of the monitors are used as features in a system that learns to combine evidence to generate high-confidence alarms. The system has been applied to the problem of detecting cellular cloning fraud based on a database of call records. Experiments indicate that this automatic approach performs better than hand-crafted methods for detecting fraud. Furthermore, this approach can adapt to the changing conditions typical of fraud detection environments.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine whether internal auditors, external auditors and economic crime investigators perceive the importance of red flags as significantly different across two fraud types: fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets, as well as across within-subject categories. A total of 471 useable responses were collected using a web-based survey. The findings indicate that significant differences exist on both single and aggregate mean levels among the participant groups. Internal auditors report a higher perceived importance of the red flags related to detecting misappropriation of assets than of those related to fraudulent financial reporting, whereas the opposite is true for economic crime investigators. For external auditors, only small differences in aggregate means between misappropriation of assets and fraudulent financial reporting were found. As the sensitivity to fraud type may affect professional planning, procedures and techniques with regard to fraud prevention, detection and investigation, the results may have both practical and theoretical implications. Further, the focus on both fraud types adds to prior literature on fraud. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {—The rapid growth of the Internet has brought with it an exponential increase in the type and frequency of cyber attacks. Many well-known cybersecurity solutions are in place to counteract these attacks. However, the generation of Big Data over computer networks is rapidly rendering these traditional solutions obsolete. To cater for this problem, corporate research is now focusing on Security Analytics, i.e., the application of Big Data Analytics techniques to cybersecurity. Analytics can assist network managers particularly in the monitoring and surveillance of real-time network streams and real-time detection of both malicious and suspicious (outlying) patterns. Such a behavior is envisioned to encompass and enhance all traditional security techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the state of the art of Security Analytics, i.e., its description, technology, trends, and tools. It hence aims to convince the reader of the imminent application of analytics as an unparalleled cybersecurity solution in the near future.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of - and classification scheme for - the literature on the application of data mining techniques for the detection of financial fraud. Although financial fraud detection (FFD) is an emerging topic of great importance, a comprehensive literature review of the subject has yet to be carried out. This paper thus represents the first systematic, identifiable and comprehensive academic literature review of the data mining techniques that have been applied to FFD. 49 journal articles on the subject published between 1997 and 2008 was analyzed and classified into four categories of financial fraud (bank fraud, insurance fraud, securities and commodities fraud, and other related financial fraud) and six classes of data mining techniques (classification, regression, clustering, prediction, outlier detection, and visualization). The findings of this review clearly show that data mining techniques have been applied most extensively to the detection of insurance fraud, although corporate fraud and credit card fraud have also attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. In contrast, we find a distinct lack of research on mortgage fraud, money laundering, and securities and commodities fraud. The main data mining techniques used for FFD are logistic models, neural networks, the Bayesian belief network, and decision trees, all of which provide primary solutions to the problems inherent in the detection and classification of fraudulent data. This paper also addresses the gaps between FFD and the needs of the industry to encourage additional research on neglected topics, and concludes with several suggestions for further FFD research. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the important practical problem of customer wallet estimation, i.e., estimation of potential spending by customers(rather than their expected spending). For this purpose we utilize quantile modeling, whose goal is to estimate a quantile of the discriminative conditional distribution of the response, rather than the mean, which is the implicit goal of most standard regression approaches. We argue that a notion of wallet can be captured through high quantile modeling (e.g, estimating the 90th percentile), and describe a wallet estimation implementation within IBM's Market Alignment Program (MAP). We also discuss the wide range of domains where high-quantile modeling can be practically important: estimating opportunities in sales and marketing domains, defining 'surprising' patterns for outlier and fraud detection and more. We survey some existing approaches for quantile modeling, and propose adaptations of nearest-neighbor and regression-tree approaches to quantile modeling. We demonstrate the various models' performance in high quantile estimation in several domains, including our motivating problem of estimating the 'realistic' IT wallets of IBM customers. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2007 ACM.},

abstract = {Due to the rise and rapid growth of E-Commerce, use of credit cards for online purchases has dramatically increased and it caused an explosion in the credit card fraud. As credit card becomes the most popular mode of payment for both online as well as regular purchase, cases of fraud associated with it are also rising. In real life, fraudulent transactions are scattered with genuine transactions and simple pattern matching techniques are not often sufficient to detect those frauds accurately. Implementation of efficient fraud detection systems has thus become imperative for all credit card issuing banks to minimize their losses. Many modern techniques based on Artificial Intelligence, Data mining, Fuzzy logic, Machine learning, Sequence Alignment, Genetic Programming etc., has evolved in detecting various credit card fraudulent transactions. A clear understanding on all these approaches will certainly lead to an efficient credit card fraud detection system. This paper presents a survey of various techniques used in credit card fraud detection mechanisms and evaluates each methodology based on certain design criteria.},

Most data in earlier research were auditor data; Later research establish model by using sharing data and public statement data. Company governance data have been widely used. It is generally believed that ratio data is more effective than accounting data; Seldom research on time Series Data Mining were conducted. The retrieved literature used mining algorithms including statistical test, regression analysis, neural networks, decision tree, Bayesian network, and stack variables etc.. Regression Analysis is widely used on hiding data. Generally the detecting effect and accuracy of NN are superior to regression model. General conclusion is that model detecting is better than auditor detecting rate without assisting. There is a need to introduce other algorithms of no-tag data mining. Owing to the small size of fraud samples, some literature reached conclusion based on training samples and may overestimated the effect of model.},

abstract = {Nationwide, financial losses due to financial statement frauds (FSF) are mounting. The industry recognizes the problem and is just now starting to act. Although prevention is the best way to reduce frauds, fraudsters are adaptive and will usually find ways to circumvent such measures. Detecting fraud is essential once prevention mechanism has failed. Several data mining algorithms have been developed that allow one to extract relevant knowledge from a large amount of data like fraudulent financial statements to detect FSF. Detecting FSF is a new attempt; thus, several research questions have often being asked: (1) Can FSF be detected? How likely and how to do it? (2) What data features can be used to predict FSF? (3) What kinds of algorithm can be used to detect FSF? (4) How to measure the performance of the detection? And (5) How effective of these algorithms in terms of fraud detection? To help answer these questions, we conduct an extensive review on literatures. We present a generic framework to guide our analysis. Critical issues for FSF detection are identified and discussed. Finally, we share directions for future research.},

abstract="Outlier detection has been used for centuries to detect and, where appropriate, remove anomalous observations from data. Outliers arise due to mechanical faults, changes in system behaviour, fraudulent behaviour, human error, instrument error or simply through natural deviations in populations. Their detection can identify system faults and fraud before they escalate with potentially catastrophic consequences. It can identify errors and remove their contaminating effect on the data set and as such to purify the data for processing. The original outlier detection methods were arbitrary but now, principled and systematic techniques are used, drawn from the full gamut of Computer Science and Statistics. In this paper, we introduce a survey of contemporary techniques for outlier detection. We identify their respective motivations and distinguish their advantages and disadvantages in a comparative review.",
